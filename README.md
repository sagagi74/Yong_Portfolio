Rework:

This assingment needs Images folder with images, Html and CSS to work properly

I have added new images to be more presentable.

I have changed the repo name with more meaningful

Also, made first image larger than the others to create a focal point and draw more attention

Also made multiple commits to repo with meaningful commit comments

Made readme.md more meaningful.

I have added new images and links as follwoing information and made responsive 
and Ensure that clicking on a featured application opens the corresponding deployed application
